# Maintainer Guide

This guide covers everything a maintainer needs to manage contributor workloads on the WorkloadGovernor contract.

## Getting Registered

Maintainers are not self-service. An admin must call `register_maintainer` for each org you need access to:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  --source <admin-account> \
  -- register_maintainer \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --maintainer <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --org_id <ORG_ID>
```

Registration is per-org. If you maintain two organizations, the admin must call this once for each. Registration is idempotent — calling it again for the same (maintainer, org) pair is a no-op.

On-chain effect: writes `("maint", maintainer, org_id) → true` to persistent storage.

## Reviewing Applications

Before assigning an issue, confirm a contributor has applied. Use the read-only query — no auth required:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  -- has_applied \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --org_id <ORG_ID> \
  --issue_id <ISSUE_ID>
```

Returns `true` if a pending application exists. You can also check how many active assignments a contributor already holds in your org:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_org_assignment_count \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --org_id <ORG_ID>
```

## Step-by-Step: Assign an Issue

**Preconditions:** the contributor must have called `apply_for_issue` first, and must have fewer than 4 active assignments in the org.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-maintainer-account> \
  -- assign_issue \
  --maintainer <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --org_id <ORG_ID> \
  --issue_id <ISSUE_ID>
```

On-chain effect:
1. Removes the pending application entry (`("app", contributor, org_id, issue_id)`).
2. Decrements the contributor's global application count (`("g_apps", contributor)`).
3. Increments the contributor's org assignment count (`("o_asgn", contributor, org_id)`).
4. Writes the assignment entry (`("asgn", org_id, issue_id, contributor) → true`).
5. Emits an `assigned` event.

## Step-by-Step: Complete an Assignment

Call this when the contributor has finished the work and the issue is resolved.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-maintainer-account> \
  -- complete_assignment \
  --maintainer <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --org_id <ORG_ID> \
  --issue_id <ISSUE_ID>
```

On-chain effect:
1. Removes the assignment entry (`("asgn", org_id, issue_id, contributor)`).
2. Decrements the contributor's org assignment count. Removes the count key entirely if it reaches 0.
3. Emits a `completed` event.

This frees one slot in the contributor's org assignment count, allowing them to be assigned other issues.

## Step-by-Step: Revoke an Assignment

Call this to cancel an active assignment — for example, if the contributor becomes unresponsive or the issue is re-scoped.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-maintainer-account> \
  -- revoke_assignment \
  --maintainer <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --org_id <ORG_ID> \
  --issue_id <ISSUE_ID>
```

On-chain effect: identical to `complete_assignment` in terms of storage mutations, but emits a `revoked` event instead of `completed`. The contributor's application is not restored — they would need to re-apply if they want to be considered again.

## Error Reference

| Code | Variant | Trigger | Remedy |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2 | `NotInitialized` | Contract has not been initialized yet | Contact the platform admin |
| 4 | `UnauthorizedMaintainer` | Your address is not registered for this org | Ask the admin to call `register_maintainer` for your address and org |
| 9 | `ApplicationNotFound` | Contributor has no pending application for this issue | Verify with `has_applied`; the application may have expired or been withdrawn |
| 10 | `AssignmentNotFound` | No active assignment exists for this contributor/issue | Verify with `is_assigned`; it may have already been completed or revoked |
| 11 | `AlreadyAssigned` | Another contributor is already assigned to this issue | Query `is_assigned` to identify who holds the assignment |
| 7 | `OrgAssignmentLimitReached` | Contributor already has 4 active assignments in this org | Wait for one of their existing assignments to be completed or revoked |
| 14 | `DeadlineInPast` | The `deadline` ledger passed before `assign_issue` was called | Use a future ledger number or omit the deadline |
| 15 | `DeadlineNotPassed` | `expire_assignment` called before the deadline ledger | Wait until the current ledger exceeds the stored deadline |
| 18 | `NoDeadlineSet` | `expire_assignment` called on an assignment with no deadline | Use `revoke_assignment` instead, or set a deadline when assigning |

## Guard Order

Every maintainer function checks preconditions in this order before mutating state:

1. Contract is initialized (`NotInitialized`)
2. Maintainer signature verified (`require_auth`)
3. Maintainer is registered for the org (`UnauthorizedMaintainer`)
4. Relevant entry exists — application or assignment (`ApplicationNotFound` / `AssignmentNotFound`)
5. Capacity/uniqueness checks — only on `assign_issue` (`OrgAssignmentLimitReached`, `AlreadyAssigned`)

If any check fails the transaction reverts with no state changes.

## Assignment Deadlines (Issue #604)

Assignments can optionally carry a **deadline** — a ledger sequence number by which
the work must be completed. Deadlines are set at assignment time and enforced by
`expire_assignment`.

### Setting a Deadline

Pass the `deadline` argument (a future ledger number) when calling `assign_issue`:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet --source <maintainer-account> \
  -- assign_issue \
  --maintainer <MAINTAINER_ADDRESS> \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --org_id my_org --issue_id 42 \
  --deadline 2500000
```

To assign without a deadline, pass `null`:

```bash
  --deadline null
```

The deadline must be strictly greater than the current ledger sequence number.
Passing a deadline in the past returns `DeadlineInPast` (error 14).

### Querying a Deadline

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_assignment_deadline \
  --org_id my_org --issue_id 42 \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS>
```

Returns the deadline ledger as a `u32`, or `null` if no deadline was set.

### Expiring an Overdue Assignment

Once the current ledger exceeds the stored deadline you can call `expire_assignment`
to free the assignment slot and emit an `expired` event:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet --source <maintainer-account> \
  -- expire_assignment \
  --maintainer <MAINTAINER_ADDRESS> \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS> \
  --org_id my_org --issue_id 42
```

On-chain effect: identical to `revoke_assignment` — removes the assignment entry,
decrements the org assignment counter, and cleans up the deadline entry. Emits
`expired` instead of `revoked` so monitors can distinguish deadline-driven expiries.

**`expire_assignment` will fail if:**

- No assignment exists (`AssignmentNotFound` — error 10).
- No deadline was set on the assignment (`NoDeadlineSet` — error 18). Use
  `revoke_assignment` for no-deadline assignments.
- The current ledger has not yet passed the deadline (`DeadlineNotPassed` — error 15).
