# Contract Resource Benchmarks

CPU instruction and memory costs for each public contract function, measured
with the Soroban SDK `cost_estimate().budget()` API in the native test environment.

CI fails automatically if any function exceeds the defined thresholds.

## How to Run

```bash
# Run benchmarks and capture output
cargo test --features testutils bench_ -- --nocapture 2>&1 | tee benchmarks.txt

# View structured output only
grep "^BENCH" benchmarks.txt
```

## Methodology

- Budget is **reset** immediately before the function under test so only that
  function's cost is measured (setup calls are excluded).
- `cpu_instruction_cost()` returns the cumulative CPU instruction count.
- `memory_bytes_cost()` returns the cumulative memory allocation in bytes.
- Native-host values **underestimate** WASM costs by approximately 10–50×.
  This is consistent with Soroban SDK documentation and confirmed by
  on-chain simulation. The thresholds account for this by being set at a
  fraction of the network limit.
- Ledger reads/writes are derived analytically from the contract source — the
  SDK v22 testutils `Budget` does not expose per-function I/O counters as a
  separate value.

## Resource Consumption Table

| Function | CPU Instructions | Memory Bytes | Ledger Reads | Ledger Writes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `apply_for_issue` | ~2,500 | ~1,500 | 3 | 3 | 2 temp writes (count + entry) + instance bump |
| `withdraw_application` | ~1,800 | ~1,200 | 3 | 3 | Removes temp entry, decrements count |
| `assign_issue` | ~4,000 | ~2,000 | 6 | 5 | Atomic transition: removes app, creates assignment |
| `complete_assignment` | ~1,800 | ~1,200 | 4 | 3 | Removes persistent assignment + counter |
| `revoke_assignment` | ~1,800 | ~1,200 | 4 | 3 | Identical cost to `complete_assignment` |
| `extend_application_ttl` | ~1,500 | ~1,000 | 2 | 0 | TTL-only updates; no value writes |
| `propose_admin` + `accept_admin` | ~2,400 | ~1,600 | 2 | 4 | propose: 1 pending write; accept: admin overwrite + remove pending + instance bump |
| `get_global_application_count` | ~400 | ~200 | 1 | 0 | Single temp read |
| `get_org_assignment_count` | ~400 | ~200 | 1 | 0 | Single persistent read |
| `has_applied` | ~400 | ~200 | 1 | 0 | Single temp read |
| `is_assigned` | ~400 | ~200 | 1 | 0 | Single persistent read |

> CPU and memory values are native-host estimates; on-chain costs are higher.
> Ledger read/write counts are analytic values derived from `src/lib.rs` and `src/storage.rs`.

## CI Thresholds

Thresholds are declared as constants in `src/test.rs` (the `benchmarks` module).
The test `bench_<function>` **panics and fails CI** if either dimension exceeds its threshold.

| Function | CPU Threshold | Memory Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_for_issue` | 500,000 | 200,000 |
| `withdraw_application` | 500,000 | 200,000 |
| `assign_issue` | 600,000 | 250,000 |
| `complete_assignment` | 500,000 | 200,000 |
| `revoke_assignment` | 500,000 | 200,000 |
| `extend_application_ttl` | 400,000 | 150,000 |
| `transfer_admin` | 800,000 | 300,000 |

All thresholds are ≤ 0.6% of the 100,000,000 CPU instruction per-transaction limit.

## Network Limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Soroban per-transaction instruction limit | 100,000,000 |
| 80% safety threshold | 80,000,000 |
| Highest function threshold in this codebase | 600,000 (assign_issue) |
| Threshold / network limit | 0.6% |

**All functions are far below the 80% safety threshold.** Even after applying
a conservative 50× WASM multiplier, `assign_issue` would consume approximately
30,000,000 instructions — 30% of the network limit, comfortably within bounds.

## Ledger Read/Write Analysis

Storage operations determine the ledger footprint of each transaction, which
affects Soroban fees directly. This table shows the operations performed by
each function:

| Function | Reads | Writes | Storage tiers touched |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apply_for_issue` | admin(P), app_entry(T), g_apps(T) | app_entry(T), g_apps(T), instance(I) | P, T, I |
| `withdraw_application` | admin(P), app_entry(T), g_apps(T) | app_entry(T), g_apps(T), instance(I) | P, T, I |
| `assign_issue` | admin(P), maintainer(P), app_entry(T), g_apps(T), o_asgn(P), asgn(P) | app_entry(T), g_apps(T), o_asgn(P), asgn(P), instance(I) | P, T, I |
| `complete_assignment` | admin(P), maintainer(P), asgn(P), o_asgn(P) | asgn(P), o_asgn(P), instance(I) | P, I |
| `revoke_assignment` | admin(P), maintainer(P), asgn(P), o_asgn(P) | asgn(P), o_asgn(P), instance(I) | P, I |
| `extend_application_ttl` | app_entry(T), g_apps(T) | TTL only — no value write | T |
| `propose_admin` | admin(P) | p_admin(P), instance(I) | P, I |
| `accept_admin` | admin(P), p_admin(P) | admin(P), p_admin(P), instance(I) | P, I |
| `get_global_application_count` | g_apps(T) | — | T |
| `get_org_assignment_count` | o_asgn(P) | — | P |
| `has_applied` | app_entry(T) | — | T |
| `is_assigned` | asgn(P) | — | P |

**Key:** P = Persistent, T = Temporary, I = Instance

## Reproducibility

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
cargo test --features testutils bench_ -- --nocapture
```

The benchmark output format is:

```
BENCH <function_name> cpu_insns=<n> mem_bytes=<n>
```

This format is consumed by the CI artifact step in `.github/workflows/contract-ci.yml`.

## WASM Binary Size

The optimized WASM binary must stay **below 20 KB** for mainnet deployment. The CI/CD
pipeline enforces a hard **22 KB gate** — any PR that pushes the binary above this
threshold will fail the `optimize` job and be blocked from merging.

### Size Targets

| Build | Target | CI Gate | Network Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo build --release` (unoptimized) | ~28 KB | — | 64 KB |
| `stellar contract optimize` (optimized) | **< 20 KB** | ≤ 22 KB | 64 KB |

> CI converts KB to bytes: 22 KB = 22 528 bytes, 64 KB = 65 536 bytes.

### How the Binary is Measured

The CI `optimize` job runs `wc -c` on the `.optimized.wasm` output from
`stellar contract optimize` and posts the result to the GitHub Actions step summary.

```bash
# Reproduce locally
stellar contract build
stellar contract optimize \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/workload_governor.wasm \
  --wasm-out target/wasm32v1-none/release/workload_governor.optimized.wasm
wc -c target/wasm32v1-none/release/workload_governor.optimized.wasm
```

### Size Reduction Techniques Applied

The following changes were made to bring the optimized binary below the 20 KB target:

| Technique | File | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| `opt-level = "z"` (minimize size) | `Cargo.toml` | High — prevents code size expansion from inlining |
| `lto = true` (link-time optimisation) | `Cargo.toml` | High — dead-strips unused code across crate boundaries |
| `codegen-units = 1` | `Cargo.toml` | Medium — enables whole-crate optimisation |
| `panic = "abort"` | `Cargo.toml` | Medium — removes panic unwinding machinery |
| `strip = "symbols"` | `Cargo.toml` | Medium — removes debug symbol table from binary |
| Removed `get_org_assignment_capacity` | `src/lib.rs` | Low — one fewer contract-exported function |
| Removed `get_global_application_capacity` | `src/lib.rs` | Low — one fewer contract-exported function |
| Removed `is_org_assignment_limit_reached` | `src/lib.rs` | Low — one fewer contract-exported function |
| Removed `is_global_app_limit_reached` | `src/lib.rs` | Low — one fewer contract-exported function |
| Fixed duplicate `global_cap_key`/`get_global_cap`/`set_global_cap` in `storage.rs` | `src/storage.rs` | Fix — was a compile error; also eliminates duplicated code |
| `soroban_sdk::Vec` (not `std::collections`) | `src/lib.rs` | Already in place — no std heap allocator overhead |
| Single dependency: `soroban-sdk 22.0.0` | `Cargo.toml` | Already optimal — no transitive bloat |

### Removed Convenience Functions

The four functions below were pure read-only wrappers with no logic beyond
calling an existing query function plus a single subtraction or comparison.
Each exported function adds to the WASM binary because the Soroban SDK
generates a dispatch entry and type descriptors for every `pub fn` on the
`#[contractimpl]` block.

| Removed function | Equivalent expression using retained functions |
|---|---|
| `get_org_assignment_capacity(c, org)` | `get_org_cap(org) - get_org_assignment_count(c, org)` |
| `get_global_application_capacity(c)` | `15 - get_global_application_count(c)` |
| `is_org_assignment_limit_reached(c, org)` | `get_org_assignment_count(c, org) >= get_org_cap(org)` |
| `is_global_app_limit_reached(c)` | `get_global_application_count(c) >= 15` |

Callers (frontends, scripts) that previously used these functions should
compute the result from the underlying query functions instead. All four
were already absent from the public API table in `README.md`.

### Profiling Guidance

If the binary drifts above the 20 KB target in future, use these tools to
identify bloat:

```bash
# Inspect WASM section sizes (requires wasm-opt from binaryen)
wasm-opt --print target/wasm32v1-none/release/workload_governor.optimized.wasm 2>&1 | head -60

# twiggy: find largest contributors to binary size
cargo install twiggy
twiggy top target/wasm32v1-none/release/workload_governor.wasm | head -30

# Check for unexpected std symbols
wasm-objdump -x target/wasm32v1-none/release/workload_governor.wasm | grep -i "alloc\|std::"
```

Common sources of unexpected size growth:
- Adding a new `pub fn` to `#[contractimpl]` (each adds ~100–300 bytes)
- Using `String` or `Vec<T>` from `std` instead of `soroban_sdk`
- Enabling a dependency feature that pulls in `std`
- Removing `#[no_std]` from `src/lib.rs`
